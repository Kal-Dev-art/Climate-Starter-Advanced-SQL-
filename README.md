I've used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, I have used use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
To do so, I've completed the following steps:

I'ved used the provided files (climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite) to complete your climate analysis and data exploration. Used the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database.
Used the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.
Linked Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
Performed a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis by completing the steps in the following two subsections.

An then, I have designed a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed.

I've connected my jupyter notebook to my database, creating engine functions, saving references to the classes and naming them correctly. 
My consistent session handling and clear JSON formatting make this implementation professional and efficient.
